\chapter{Choice of Readout Electronics for the 3DMiMic Detector}
\label{e}

\section{Medipix and Timepix}
\label{e-medipix}
Medipix is a family of chips developed to exploit technology from the experiments at CERN in other fields of science, mainly medical imaging. The chips made by the Medipix collaboration are; Medipix1, Medipix2, Timepix, Medipix3, Timepix3, and Dosepix. The Medipix 1-3 chips are made for photon counting and are therefore not useful for dosimetry. The Timepix chips are made to do \gls{ToT} measurements, with Timepix and Timepix3 being based on Medipix2 and Medipix3 respectively. Dosepix is a currently in development chip made for photon dosimetry. Timepix3 and Dosepix were considered for the 3DMiMic project, but as \gls{ToT} their dynamic range is not very large. Also, since they are made for photon detectors they cannot read the large charges released by a carbon ion in the Bragg peak. 

\section{UiO Portable Front-End Readout System}
\label{e-uio}
During the school year 2014-2015 two master students at \gls{uio} made a portable front-end readout system for radiation detectors. \citep{tali} \citep{oltedal} This system consists of two custom made cards and a \gls{FPGA} evaluation board. The first card, the analog card, has three channels with pre-amplifiers while two of those channels also including shapers. The second card, the digital card, includes an \gls{ADC}, comparators, and current monitors. The components of the digital card is connected to the \gls{FPGA} on the SoCKit evaluation board by Arrow, which is connected to a computer through network. 

\section{IDEAS Amadeus preamp-shaper}
\label{e-ide1180}
IDE1180, or Amadeus, by Oslo-based IDEAS is an integrated circuit for the front-end readout of radiation detectors. It features 16 channels of \gls{CSA} and shapers with adjustable shaping time. The preliminary datasheet \citep{IDE1180} specifies a shaping time between 20 ns and 40 ns, negative and positive input charges up to 400 fC with lowest gain, and equivalent noise charge of 1106 e- plus 68 e- per pF load at default gain.
